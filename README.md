# My Dotfiles

These are the different configuration pieces I use for my local setup on MacOS.  Feel free to take anything you may find useful and modify it to suit your needs.  **Disclaimer:** this mostly serves as a utility for me to track my preferred configurations and as a guide/reminder for steps to perform when I setup a new MacOS machine -- considering this doesn't happen very often, `setup.sh` may not function 100%.

Below are some general purpose notes.

### etc

This is for misc. items such as color schemes, themes and fonts (although I primarily install my desired fonts with Homebrew now).

### git

This is my Git config file.  Nothing too special here except some global Git settings that I prefer.

### nano

I have some custom plugins installed for nano to make basic text editing a bit easier.

### taskwarrior

I haven't been using taskwarrior as of late so this is a leftover config file from when I was using it.

### vim

I'm not a vim user but I like to keep a lightweight configuration for the occassions where I do need to use vim.

### zsh

zsh configuration files.  Nothing too complicated.

### Brewfile

I use this to track and manage the casks/packages I install with Homebrew.

### setup.sh

This is the install script to bootstrap a new machine.  **Like I mentioned above, this isn't always tested and may not work 100% without some tweaks.  It mostly serves as a guide/set of reminders.**
